ACC officials have been investigating Khokan's business activities for several months, but it is unclear what specific allegations were made against him during the meeting.\n\nThe ACC has found that four private cars are registered in Khokan's name, which could be evidence of his illegal dealings. The ACC has also discovered that Khokan has been involved in a number of other business transactions, including a deal to purchase a large quantity of wheat from a US company.\n\nACC officials have said that they will take the allegations seriously and investigate them thoroughly. \"We will look into all the evidence we have gathered so far and see if there is any concrete proof of Khokan's wrongdoing,\" an ACC official said. \"We will also review his business dealings in the United States to see if he has any connections to corrupt individuals or organizations.\"\n\nThe ACC has been criticized for its handling of the Khokan probe, with some accusing it of being slow and ineffective. However, the ACC has defended its decision, saying that it is taking the allegations seriously and will not hesitate to take action against those who engage in corrupt practices.\n\nIn recent weeks, there have been reports of a number of high-profile businessmen and politicians being arrested for their involvement in corruption schemes.

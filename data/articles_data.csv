Hasinaâ€™s ouster grabs global headlines,"The ouster of the Sheikh Hasina-led government dominated the international media yesterday. Hasina's 15-year rule ended today as she fled weeks of deadly protests and the military announced it would form an interim government. Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a broadcast to the nation on state television that Hasina had resigned and the military would form an interim government. International media reports said Hasina, 76, was flown in a military helicopter with her sister and was headed to India. The CNN News 18 television channel, an Indian TV station, said she had landed in Agartala, the capital of India's northeastern state of Tripura, across the eastern border of Bangladesh. However, other Indian media reported that the ousted PM landed in Delhi at 5:36pm at the Hindon Air Base in Ghaziabad where she was received by Air Force officials. Several Indian media, where the news dominated all through the day, reported that she might fly to London. Several news outlets including BBC also reported widespread looting and arson across the country since the ouster. News agencies Reuters and AFP ran several articles on the developments that took place before and after the ouster. According to AFP, security forces, who had supported Hasina's government throughout the unrest, did not intervene to stem Sunday's protests which claimed at least 94 lives. It said, with Sunday's deaths, the total toll of the violence that began in early July over the quota reform protest is now at least 300. It also showed images of crowds running into the Gono Bhaban, the official residence of Hasina as PM, waving to the camera as they celebrated, looting furniture and books, with others relaxing on beds. Others smashed a statue of Hasina's father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence hero. Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center, told AFP that Hasina's departure ""would leave a major vacuum"". ""If it's a peaceful transition, with an interim set-up taking over until elections are held, then stability risks would be modest and the consequences would be limited,"" he said. ""But if there is a violent transition or a period of uncertainty, that could risk more destabilisation and problems inside and outside."" According to a Reuters report, Army chief Zaman said he had held ""fruitful"" talks with leaders of all major political parties he had ""invited"" and would soon meet President Mohammed Shahabuddin to discuss the way ahead. He also urged ""a little time"" to ensure peace and stability. However, some of the crowd, who thronged the Gono Bhaban, were seen carrying away televisions, chairs and tables from what was one of the most protected buildings in the country. CNN also reported on the development with a long article. ""Whatever demands you have, we will fulfil and bring back peace to the nation, please help us in this, stay away from violence,"" it quoted the army chief as saying. ""The military will not fire at anyone, the police will not fire at anyone, I have given orders,"" the army chief added as per the report. The ouster of Sheikh Hasina was the lead news on BBC's website. Besides describing the jubilation after the ouster and the bloodshed before it, quoting BBC Bangla, it reported about widespread looting in Dhaka. Besides the Gono Bhaban, it also reported on attacks on Asaduzzaman Khan, the home minister of the ousted government, in the Dhanmondi area of the capital. Quoting Lutfey Siddiqi, a visiting professor-in-practice at the London School of Economics, BBC also reported on the ""inevitable"" economic crisis the country faces. ""Sheikh Hasina's government appears to have lost both the right and might to govern. Soon it will run out of the resources to do so as well,"" Siddiqi told the BBC. ""Bangladesh is on the verge of an economic implosion."" India Today said Bangladesh was engulfed in political uncertainty with the resignation of Sheikh Hasina. It also showed short clips of people who stormed the Gono Bhaban. NDTV ran several news on the developments. In its lead piece titled ""Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina Quits, Army Coup Amid Massive Protests"", it said Hasina landed at Hindon airbase near Delhi after ""fleeing Bangladesh"". The Hindu said Hasina ""succumbed to the protest"" and tendered her resignation. The report said Hasina had taken shelter in India before, but ""this time it was not a coup"" as it reported widespread anger over the recent violence. The Dawn, Pakistan's leading news outlet, ran the development as a lead. It said, ""Bangladesh's army chief will form an interim government after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled Dhaka in the face of overwhelming protests"" Xinhua, the official state news agency of the People's Republic of China, ran a five-paragraph news on the development titled ""Bangladesh PM resigns, interim government to run country: army chief"". The Indian Express ran an article titled ""From longest-serving PM of Bangladesh to fleeing the country: The rise and fall of Sheikh Hasina"" alongside several others detailing the current developments and more. Calling her ""the world's longest-serving female head of government"", the news outlet said, ""Hasina's opponents have constantly accused her of growing increasingly autocratic and called her a threat to the country's democracy."""
Hasina may be on way to London via India: diplomatic sources,"Sheikh Hasina, who resigned as Bangladesh Prime Minister earlier today following unprecedented anti-government protests, may be on her way to London through India, multiple diplomatic sources in India said. Hasina is learnt to be travelling in a C130J transport aircraft of the Bangladesh Air Force and it is expected to have a stopover in India, India's civil aviation sources said. It is not immediately clear whether the military transport aircraft will take her beyond India or she will travel to London in a different plane. The military plane, the most tracked plane today on website Flight Radar 24 which tracks the flight of all planes, was expected to land in Hindon Air Base near Delhi around 6:00pm Indian time."
"Arrest, send back Hasina, Rehana: SCBA president urges India ","The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President AM Mahbub Uddin Khokon today called on India to arrest former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her sister Sheikh Rehana, and send them back to Bangladesh. ""We want to maintain a good relationship with the people of India. Please, arrest Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana, who fled the country, and send them back to Bangladesh. Sheikh Hasina has killed many people in Bangladesh,"" he said. Barrister Khokon, who is also a joint secretary general of the BNP, urged the authorities not to declare a state of emergency. ""There is talk of issuing a state of emergency. We don't want a government like that of Moeen U Ahmed and Fakhruddin Ahmed. No one, including the students, wants the state of emergency. They will not accept it and will protest if any initiative is taken to issue it,"" he said during a press conference at the SCBA auditorium, where several pro-BNP lawyers were present. The SCBA president demanded that Supreme Court judges who have engaged in politics and corruption resign within one week. ""Many judges have ordered the remand of BNP men and sentenced them in false cases, breaking their oaths and being overly enthusiastic. HC judges have acquitted Awami League leader Mofazzal Hossain in a case filed for amassing illegal wealth, while BNP leaders Iqbal Hassan Mahmud Tuku and Aman Ullah Aman were imprisoned in similar cases. Judges who have judged politically, breaking their oaths, are unfit to remain as judges. They have no right to stay in their positions. I request them to resign within a week. We will disclose their names if they don't step down,"" he said. He also demanded resignations of the state law officers including Attorney General AM Amin Uddin, and the chiefs and officials of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) and National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) within a week as they were appointed by the Sheikh Hasina-led government. Khokon said many political prisoners, who have been suffering in jails, must be released immediately. ""The president has said that they will be released on bail. They must not only be granted bail, but the cases filed against them should also be withdrawn by executive order of the government under Section 494 of the Criminal Procedure Code,"" he said. Additionally, the Jatiotabadi Ainjibi Forum, a body of pro-BNP lawyers, led by its President Zainul Abedin and Secretary General Kayser Kamal, organized a meeting and held a procession at the SCBA premises to celebrate the success of the movement against the Sheikh Hasina-led government."
Hasina will return to Bangladesh the moment elections are announced: Joy,"Sheikh Hasina will come back to Bangladesh as soon as the interim government decides to hold an election, said the former prime minister's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy in an interview with Times of India yesterday. ""For the time being, she is in India. She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election. I am thankful to PM Narendra Modi for saving my mother's life at such short notice."" Sheikh Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled Bangladesh on August 5, when a student-led protest culminated in a mass uprising against her Awami League government. More than 400 people were killed in the preceding three weeks, a majority of them in police firing and firing by Awami League activists. Stating that the Awami League leaders were still allegedly under attack in Bangladesh, Joy said, ""I will do whatever it takes to save the party and its workers. If there is a need for me to join politics, I will not refrain from that. My mother would have retired from politics after the current term. I never had any political ambition and was settled in the US. ""But the developments in Bangladesh in the past few days show that there is a leadership vacuum. I had to get active for the sake of the party and I am at the forefront now."" While more than 140 people were killed in the mob violence and rioting on August 5 following Hasina's fleeing, the violence has reduced markedly since then as the students have been on the streets in the absence of law enforcement. The security forces have also become active amid reports of looting at night. There have also been attacks on members of the Hindu community, especially outside Dhaka. Joy's statements came after Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party's acting chairman, is returning to Dhaka following his exile from Bangladesh. Speaking right after the new interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge of Bangladesh, Joy said, ""I am sure the Awami League will take part in the election and we might even win. We have the largest supporter base in Bangladesh."" He also claimed that his mother (Hasina) has no plans for seeking asylum in any country. Joy stressed there was a need for ""introspection"". ""There definitely were 'mistakes'. When you run a country, a lot of decisions are made every day. Awami League believes in introspection and we were ready for that. But we did not get a chance to do that this time. We never realised the situation would escalate so fast,"" Joy said. He also said an alliance of BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami will not be able to save the minorities. ""If the Awami League is not in power, the eastern border of India will not be secure. If there is an alliance of BNP and Jamaat, that may not be good for India as Jamaat will not refrain from militancy,"" Joy said, requesting India to mount pressure on Bangladesh to hold elections soon. The Awami League government, during its 15 years in power, and Hasina herself was sharply critical of any political opponent or civil society member calling for foreign pressure in domestic policies. Joy's comments come after he had earlier in the week said that his family were ""done with politics""."

"Hasina falls, flees ","Bangladesh's iron lady of 15 years bowed out to a people's uprising yesterday. Serving as the prime minister since 2009, Sheikh Hasina was forced to resign and flee the country as hundreds of thousands marched towards Dhaka defying a curfew amid a continual morning drizzle. The streets of the capital that had convulsed with violence and death over the last three weeks, reverberated with wild celebrations as soon as the Bangladesh army chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, confirmed the rumours of Hasina's resignation. He went on to say that a new interim government will be formed soon. Millions took to the streets gridlocking the entire capital well into the evening while many found it hard to believe that Hasina's absolute hold on authority and Awami League's fabled political fortress could crumble, faced with a three-week campaign initiated by students.  








Revellers stormed the prime minister's residence, office and the parliament. They also ransacked Awami League offices and residences of high-ranking ministers across the country.



Even while thousands converged on Shahbagh from early afternoon, there were reports of violence between demonstrators and police officials on the fringes of Dhaka and from around Bangladesh amid the vacuum that was left in the wake of Hasina's hasty departure without so much as a statement or press release.

A fledgling student protest against reserved quotas for government jobs that began on July 1 started to gain momentum as the government dealt with them harshly. Despite reassurances of no harassment, the AL government employed excessive force to subdue a campaign leading to over 300 deaths. That protest transformed into a strong anti-government campaign over the last week and culminated in a people's uprising yesterday as the student campaigners called for their compatriots to ""march to Dhaka"". This was particularly in reply to AL's show of political force on Sunday, which left at least 93 dead in a single day's violence. Another 66 were killed yesterday in Dhaka alone.
Droves of people began gathering in neighbourhoods of Dhaka and its outskirts ready to converge in the capital's Shahbagh from early morning. There were also thousands gathering outside the capital and marching towards it, braving all obstacles. The strong tide turned on the back of university students.



About 43 years after Hasina had flown into Dhaka as the newly elected AL president for the first time, she took off on a military helicopter with her younger sister Sheikh Rehana to India.
The five-time prime minister landed in Agartala, the capital of India's northeastern state of Tripura. Thereafter, the 77-year-old premier was flown to Hindon Air Force Base in Ghaziabad, about 30km from the Indian capital of New Delhi, according to Indian news outlets India Today and NDTV.

Hasina was reported to have met with the Indian national security adviser, Ajit Doval, in the evening at Hindon. It is widely reported that Hasina will seek asylum in London. Later in the evening Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a high-level meeting with key ministers and intelligence chiefs who briefed him about the unfolding situation in Bangladesh, according to reports in Indian media.
Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, the former PM's ICT affairs adviser, told BBC that his mother would not ""come back"" to politics.
Back in Dhaka, before he took the podium at the army headquarters to address the nation, flanked by the air chief and naval chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman met with several politicians and members of the civil society including representatives of BNP, Jatiya Party, Jamaat-e-Islami, other politicians and teachers. The AL was not represented. The student campaigners were not present there either. Leaders of the student protest campaign have announced that they will present an outline for the interim government soon.

In the context of hundreds of violent deaths, the army chief reassured everyone that justice would be ensured for each. He said it was now everyone's responsibility to remain calm.
""Together, we hope to go towards a better situation,"" he said addressing the media. ""I am taking full responsibility.""
""The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed. It is time to stop the violence.""
On his way to the presidential palace, Bangabhaban, the army chief was greeted by jubilant crowd. Hundreds thronged around the general's convoy and some even rode on his car as the convoy slowly glided through the teeming millions who hailed the army chief like a triumphant hero.

Giving Hasina time to recover before speaking to her: Jaishankar,"The Indian government is giving former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who resigned and went there yesterday, some time ""to recover"" before talking to her, said India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar today. He was speaking at an all-party meeting at the Parliament House today. He said it had not even been 24 hours since Hasina arrived in the neighbouring country, and she is in a state of shock, and so the government was giving her time to recover before speaking speaking to her about various issues. He said the government would give her the necessary assistance. As per meeting sources, he also mentioned that India had spoken to the Bangladesh army chief, asking for the safety of over 10,000 Indian students in Bangladesh. Replying to questions from various leaders, the minister said households and properties belonging to minorities were targeted by agitators in the neighbouring country. Various leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, conveyed their full cooperation to the government in this regard, reports our New Delhi correspondent."
"Extradite Hasina, let her face trial: Fakhrul","BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir today asked India to extradite ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh and let her face trial. ""It is our call to you that you should hand her over to the government of Bangladesh in a legal way. The people of this country have given the decision for her trial. Let her face that trial,"" he said. The BNP secretary general made this call while talking to reporters after paying tribute to BNP founder Ziaur Rahman in the city. He along with two newly inducted members of the party's standing committee -- Maj (retd) Hafiz Uddin Ahmed and AZM Zahid Hossain -- paid tribute by placing a wreath at the grave of former president Ziaur Rahman. Fakhrul said India is seemingly not keeping its commitment towards democracy by providing shelter to her. ""Staying there, she has started various plots to thwart the revolution that happened in Bangladesh,"" he alleged. The BNP secretary general said the people of this country do not consider her offences as minor. He said they think her fascist rule has weakened Bangladesh's independence and hindered the country's progress for the last 15 years. During her regime, she made a debt burden of Tk 18 lakh crores for the nation and nearly $100 billion dollars were siphoned off from the country, said Fakhrul, adding that all institutions of the country were destroyed during her misrule. Interim government has been doing a commendable job, he said. The main task of this interim government, which was formed through a revolution and mass upsurge, is to hand over the power to the public representatives by holding an election, Fakhrul added. ""But we think it will definitely take some time to clear the garbage the Awami League government created. It will take time to hold a proper and fair election,"" he said. Replying to a question, the BNP Secretary General praised the current interim government's activities. ""The work done by it in 11 days is undoubtedly commendable work,"" he said"

Ouster of Hasina: BNP's Hafizuddin commends army,"BNP standing committee member Maj (retd) Hafizuddin Ahmed today congratulated the Bangladesh Army for its role in ""removing"" Sheikh Hasina from power. He was appointed member of the BNP standing committee yesterday. ""I had lost hope, but at the momentous occasion, the Bangladesh Army took sufficient and proper action to remove Sheikh Hasina. I congratulate them for this,"" Hafizuddin said during a programme, organised by Bangladesh Jatiotabadi Muktijoddha Dal at Jatiya Press Club. ""There was a lot of anger against them [Bangladesh Army]. The army is a traditional force. The language of army members, especially senior officers, should be soldier-like. But for the last 14 years, I have seen them giving speeches like those of Chhatra League. What a shameâ€¦ But in the end, they responded to the people's call and took the right action. They removed the dictator,"" he mentioned. He also questioned police's use of military-grade weapons during the recent crackdown. ""They are the police. Who gave them LMG, MG, 7.62 rifles of the military? Hasina's government did. These weapons were not supposed to be with them,"" he said."
Hasina sued in two more murder cases,"Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina has been accused in two more murder cases. With this, Hasina is now facing 10 cases, including seven for murder, one for abduction, and two for committing crimes against humanity and genocide. In Narayanganj, Hasina, along with former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan and 46 others, was sued over the killing of a 20-year-old man during a clash between protesters and Awami League men on August 5. Abul Bashar Anik, brother of the victim, Abul Hasan Sajan, 20, who was shot in the city's Chashara area, filed the case last night, said Abdus Sattar, officer-in-charge of Narayanganj Sadar Model Police Station. Former MP AKM Shamim Osman, his brother former MP AKM Selim Osman, son Imtinan Osman Ayon, nephew Azmery Osman, brother-in-law Tanvir Ahmed Titu, who is also a director of Bangladesh Cricket Board, and Narayanganj City Corporation Mayor Salina Hayat Ivy's younger brother Ahammad Ali Reza Uzzal were also among the accused. Around 100-150 unnamed people were also accused in the case. According to the case statement, a few hours before the announcement of Hasina's resignation on August 5, Sajan was shot at Chashara during the clash between protesters and Awami League men. ""He died while undergoing treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital the following morning,"" Sajan's brother Anik had told The Daily Star earlier. Sajan, son of Jakir Hossain, was a sales representative at a private company. He was living with his family at Kushiara village in Narayanganj's Bandar upazila.

UK shouldnâ€™t offer asylum to Hasina,"Bangladesh origin British MP Rupa Huq has said it would be unwise for the UK to give refuge to Sheikh Hasina. ""As a British Bangladeshi MP, my inbox is a lightning rod for Bangladeshi issues worldwide. At the moment, pleading mails ask me to 'ban the butcher' and similar requests as it is rumoured London is her next destination,"" she wrote in an opinion column published by the Standard newspaper of UK on Friday. ""I personally think given the deep unpopularity of her bloodthirsty regime and political sensitivities around immigration, it'd be unwise for the UK to give refuge to such a high-profile asylum seeker who is subject of an International Criminal Court application,"" Huq opined. Huq wrote that the recent student unrest, where hundreds of unarmed minors were killed by police under a ""shoot on sight"" policy resembling that of stormtroopers, sparked protests by expatriates in Paris, Rome, Manchester, Trafalgar Square and Middle East. Many Bangladeshis think she should return to face charges there, she said. Huq said there is a collective sense of relief among her Bangladeshi cousins, as the atmosphere of fear surrounding any criticism of the government seems to be easing. However, risks remain, she said. The deposed camp argues they maintained stability, but as elections approach, it's time for a change, she added. Instead of the ongoing feud between two families that has marked Bangladesh's history, the country should aim for a fresh start, she said."
Hasina accused in another murder case,"Another murder case was filed today against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and 15 others over the death of a 12-year-old school student in Mohammadpur during the quota protests on July 19. The other accused are Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader, former ministers -- Asaduzzaman Khan, Anisul Huq, Tajul Islam, Jahangir Kabir Nanak, Hasan Mahmud and Mohammad A Arafat â€“, former private industry affairs adviser to former prime minister Salman F Rahman and former lawmaker Mostofa Jalal Mohiuddin, former inspector general of police Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun, Rab's former DG Harun Or Rashid, former DMP commissioner Habibur Rahman, former Additional IGP Kh Mahid Uddin, former DB (DMP) chief Harun Or Rashid and former DMP joint commissioner Biplob Kumar Sarker. Abdullah Abu Sayeed Bhuiyan, a resident of Tejgaon, today filed the case with the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Rajesh Chowdhury over the death of a student, Jobayed Hossain Imon, 12, in police firing in Dhaka's Mohammadpur area during quota reform protests on July 19. This is the fifth case, and the third murder case, lodged against Hasina after she resigned and went to India amid a mass upsurge on August 5. After a hearing, the magistrate recorded the complainant's statement and directed the officer-in-charge of Mohammadpur Police Station to register the complaint as a first information report (FIR), Md Nur Alam, a court staffer, told The Daily Star. In the case, several unnamed Rab personnel have also been accused."
Bangabandhu shouldnâ€™t suffer for Hasinaâ€™s deeds,"Kader Siddique Bir Uttam, the president of the Krishak Sramik Janata League, was attacked while attempting to pay his respects to the memory of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Dhanmondi 32 in the capital. On Thursday morning, his car was vandalised. Kader Siddique told The Daily Star, ""I went to pay respect [to Bangabandhu] at seven in the morning, but I couldn't. It felt nice that a few people respectfully asked me to go backâ€¦ I was inside the car. However, some people threw stones and vandalised the car with sticks. After that, I left."" Regarding the restriction on entering Bangabandhu's residence, he said, ""Throughout history, whenever there is a change, a lot happens during those unstable times. If the anti-discrimination student movement cannot keep up with people's expectations, its achievements will be lost. Today, I saw some people tied up with ropes [near the Dhanmondi 32 area], which is unacceptable."" The veteran freedom fighter urged the students and youth to differentiate between justice and vengeance. ""If someone commits a crime, they should be punished, but suppressing opposing views is not right,"" he added. ""I also want to say that Sheikh Hasina and Bangabandhu should not be treated as the same, nor should Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League be equated. It would be wrong to try to destroy the Awami League due to Sheikh Hasina's flawed leadership,"" said Kader Siddique."
India pressed US to go easy on Hasina: report,"A year before she was deposed on August 5 in a student uprising, Indian officials began to lobby their US counterparts to stop pressuring Sheikh Hasina, the ironfisted prime minister of neighboring Bangladesh, The Washington Post said quoting US and Indian officials. According to its report, US diplomats had publicly harangued the 76-year-old Hasina for jailing thousands of her rivals and critics ahead of an election scheduled for last January. The Biden administration had sanctioned a Bangladeshi police unit under Hasina's command accused of carrying out extrajudicial abductions and killings and had threatened imposing visa restrictions on Bangladeshis who undermined democracy or committed human rights abuses. But in a series of meetings, Indian officials demanded that the United States tone down its pro-democracy rhetoric. If the opposition were allowed to gain power in an open election, Indian officials argued, Bangladesh would become a breeding ground for Islamist groups posing a threat to India's national security. ""You approach it at the level of democracy, but for us, the issues are much, much more serious and existential,"" said an Indian government adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks. ""There were a lot of conversations with the Americans where we said, 'This is a core concern for us, and you can't take us as a strategic partner unless we have some kind of strategic consensus.'"" Ultimately, the Biden administration substantially softened its criticism and shelved threats of further sanctions against Hasina's government, disappointing many in Bangladesh. US officials say it was a calculated decision that had little to do with Indian pressure. Many details of the bilateral discussions and US deliberations have not been reported previously. Now, after protesters defied the army's curfew orders and marched on Hasina's official residence, compelling her to flee to India, policymakers in both New Delhi and Washington are forced to confront whether they mishandled Bangladesh. ""There is always a balancing act in Bangladesh, as there is in many places where the situation on the ground is complicated and you want to work with the partners you have in a way that is not inconsistent with what the American people expect,"" said a US official, who like several others interviewed spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter's diplomatic sensitivity. In the months leading up to the January election, divisions emerged within the US government over how to handle Bangladesh. Some in the US State Department, including then-Ambassador Peter Haas and other embassy officials, argued for a tougher stance against Hasina, particularly since President Joe Biden had campaigned on a foreign policy plank of restoring democracy, people familiar with the matter said. Haas, who has since retired, declined to comment. Other US officials felt there was little to be gained from further alienating Hasina and risking the safety of US diplomats, including Haas, who had received threats from Hasina's followers. Some White House officials also considered the downside of antagonising India, which made a series of appeals to the US that it moderate its pressure on Hasina, including when Indian Minister of External Affairs S Jaishankar and Defense Minister Rajnath Singh met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in November in New Delhi, according to the people familiar with the matter. Indian national security adviser Ajit Doval also played a key role in presenting the Indian case during a visit to Washington that autumn, one of those people said. For India, the dramatic developments in Bangladesh have turned a spotlight on its decade-long, all-in bet on Hasina, even as she grew autocratic and unpopular. For the United States, the episode has highlighted a growing dilemma: While India is seen by the Biden administration as a crucial partner in countering China, India itself is increasingly viewed by its smaller neighbors in South Asia as a meddling, aggressively nationalist power under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In January, after Hasina claimed victory in a one-sided election with many of her opponents in jail or in hiding, Indian officials endorsed the election results, fueling calls from the Bangladeshi opposition for a boycott of Indian imports. Last year, in the tiny Indian Ocean country of the Maldives, Mohamed Muizzu rose to power as president by campaigning on an ""India Out"" platform. And in Sri Lanka, anti-Indian sentiment flared this year after Modi claimed on the campaign trail that his opponents gave India's rightful territory cheaply away to Sri Lanka. ""The US has built its relationship with India and has this tendency to defer to its wishes in the region, and probably nowhere was that more evident than Bangladesh,"" said Jon Danilowicz, a retired US diplomat who served as deputy chief of mission in Dhaka. ""But the risk is like Iran 1979: If you're seen as colluding with the dictator, when the dictator falls, you're left playing catch-up."" (The United States strongly backed the autocratic shah of Iran before he was overthrown during the Islamic Revolution.) Now, Danilowicz added, ""New Delhi and Washington have to show some humility and acknowledge they got Bangladesh wrong by not siding with the Bangladeshi people and their democratic aspirations."" After Hasina's ouster, which followed weeks of unrest in which hundreds of protesters were killed, Indian officials have publicly changed tack and expressed willingness to work with whoever comes to power. Last week, Modi sent his ""best wishes"" to Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Prize-winning banker who took charge of Bangladesh's interim government, even though he criticised India for backing Hasina. Yunus has called for new, free and fair elections once stability is restored in the country. The State Department endorsed Yunus, with spokesman Matthew Miller saying the United States hoped to see ""the Bangladeshi people decide the future of the Bangladeshi government."" Aside from the United States, India had simultaneously warned other Western governments about the dangers of the opposition Bangladeshi Nationalist Party (BNP) returning to power. ""It was intense,"" recalled an official from a Western country allied with the United States. ""They started briefing Western governments that Bangladesh could become the next Afghanistan, that the BNP could lead to instability, violence and terror."" Indian officials say they have reason to feel burned by the Bangladeshi opposition. During the rule of Hasina's rivals, the BNP, in the mid-2000s, militants smuggled weapons to attack northeast India and trained in camps inside Bangladesh with the help of Pakistani intelligence, Indian officials say. Indian and US officials say this experience with BNP rule explained why India had been so adamant on keeping Hasina in power for 15 years. BNP leaders, who could win if elections are soon held, say they have met Indian officials in recent years to mend ties and assure them that India â€” and Hindus in Bangladesh â€” would be safe if India stopped propping up Hasina and the BNP returned. ""We've been in touch with India, trying to tell them, 'Don't put all your eggs in one basket,'"" said Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury, a senior BNP leader. ""We have tried to assuage whatever concerns India has. It would be stupid for both sides to carry the baggage of the past."" As India grapples with the shock of suddenly losing one of its closest allies, Indian foreign policy circles and media have been awash with speculation that Washington orchestrated the removal of Hasina, who has long had a chilly relationship with the United States. US officials have staunchly denied the claim. Others in New Delhi say India was to blame for propping up an autocrat for so long. A former senior Indian national security official said it made sense, in theory, to support Hasina, but New Delhi did not grasp the situation on the ground. ""Everybody who came from Dhaka were giving the same feedback that anti-India feelings are at an unprecedented level, yet we calculated that she has full control over the administrative and coercive arms of the state,"" the former Indian official said. ""We thought repeated attempts to destabilise the government have failed, so she will manage again. The truth is, the whole thing just needed a spark to set the whole house on fire."""
Hasina's 'first statement' after ouster,"Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, now in India after the fall of her government following a mass uprising, today demanded an investigation into the killings, vandalism and arson carried out in the name of agitation. She also demanded that the culprits be identified and brought to justice. Sajeeb Wazed Joy, Hasina's son, posted her statement on his verified Facebook page tonight. Hasina was compelled to step down on August 5 following the student protests, which saw over 500 people killed. In the statement, she said, ""Since July, lots of lives have been lost in violence, arson in the name of protests. I express my condolences and prayers for the victims, including students, teachers, police, journalists, cultural activists and a pregnant police woman, members of Awami League and its associate bodies, pedestrians and various professionals."" She conveyed sympathy to the bereaved families. In her statement, Hasina recalled the massacre of August 15, 1975 when Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family members were assassinated. Hasina, the eldest daughter of Bangabandhu, also expressed grief over the vandalism and arson at the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum at Dhanmondi 32 and sought justice from country's people. She urged all to observe the National Mourning Day on August 15 in a befitting manner by placing floral wreaths at Bangabandhu Bhaban and offering prayers."
Another murder case filed against Hasina,"A murder case was filed against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and 23 others over the death of Dhaka Degree College student Foijul Islam Rajon, 18, in the capital's Kafrul area on July 19. This is the second murder case filed against Hasina since she resigned and fled the country in the face of a mass uprising on August 5. The victim's brother Md Rajib filed the case with the Court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Ahmed Humayun Kabir. Former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan, former Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader, former law minister Anisul Huq, former inspector general of police Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, former DB chief Harun Or Rashid, former DMP commissioner Habibur Rahman and former DMP joint commissioner Biplob Kumar Sarkar are among the accused. After the hearing, the magistrate recorded the statement of complainant and asked the officer-in-charge of Kafrul Police Station to register it as a first information report. Earlier today, five people, including Hasina, Asaduzzaman and Anisul, were sued over the abduction and torture of Supreme Court lawyer Sohel Rana in February 2015. Yesterday, a case was filed against Hasina, Asaduzzaman and five others over the death of grocery shop owner Abu Sayed in police firing in the capital's Mohammadpur area during quota reform protests on July 19."
Nahid Islam wants Hasina to face trial,"A Bangladeshi student leader who was instrumental in overthrowing Sheikh Hasina and is now part of an interim government said she must face trial when she returns home as planned for the killings during her term, including during recent protests, which led her to resign and flee on Monday. About 300 people, many of them university and college students, were killed in the demonstrations that began in July with students demonstrating against quotas in government jobs before spiralling into violent protests to oust Hasina, who had ruled Bangladesh for 20 of the last 30 years. Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy has said she will return to Bangladesh from India, where she is sheltering, once elections are announced in her home country, which the main opposition has demanded should be held in three months. ""I am curious why she fled the country,"" student leader Nahid Islam, who is effectively a minister in the interim government, told Reuters late on Friday in his first interview since joining the government on Thursday as an adviser. ""We will seek justice for all the killings that happened under her, that has been one of the main demands of our revolution. Even if she does not come back, we will work towards that."" ""We want to arrest her - whether that will work through the regular judicial system or a special tribunal on that or not, we are discussing how to proceed on the matter,"" said Islam, 26, who now heads the postal, telecommunication and information technology ministries. Joy, who is based in the United States, did not respond to a request seeking comment. Hasina, who is under the protection of the Indian government, could not be contacted. Another student leader, Abu Baker Mojumder, separately told Reuters they want Hasina to return and face trial. Islam said one of the caretaker government's main priorities was to hold a free and fair election, after the last election was boycotted by the opposition, and also investigate suspected corruption in the previous government. Islam said Bangladesh would need electoral and constitutional reforms before any election, so it was not clear when the next vote would be held. He declined to give a specific timeline. ""My ambition on what I next become depends on the people of Bangladesh,"" he said when asked whether one day he would like to be prime minister. He said India had fostered a relationship with Hasina's Awami League party, but not the people of Bangladesh as a whole. ""We want friendly ties with India,"" he said. ""India also needs to look at its foreign policy, else it will become a problem for the whole of South Asia."""
Try Hasina in intâ€™l crimes tribunal,"Leaders of the students against discrimination platform yesterday demanded that the government file a case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her associates in the International Crimes Tribunal for ""killing students and people"". They came up with the demand at a protest rally organised at the base of Raju Memorial Sculpture on the Dhaka University campus. They also demanded a ban on organisation-based student politics on all campuses, citing various terrorist activities of Chhatra League in the educational institutions. Criticising the advisers of the interim government, coordinator Hasnat Abdullah said, ""We had seen the advisers talking about rehabilitating the murderers [Sheikh Hasina and other AL leaders]. We want to remind these advisers that you have come to power through the student-people uprising."" ""We will not hesitate to oust you just the way we made you advisers,"" he warned. Hasnat also said those who want to rehabilitate AL in this country will be resisted by the students and people. Addressing the media, he said, ""We have a cordial relationship with the media. The role of media in making our movement global is undeniable. But we can see that some media are trying to rehabilitate those fallen. We urge the media to realise the people's pulse."" Speaking at the event, Akhter Hossen, former social welfare secretary of Dhaka University Central Students' Union and convener of Gonotantrik Chhatra Shakti, said, ""Sheikh Hasina has fled the country but is still hatching various conspiracies while sitting abroad."" He also asked the students to get prepared to protect the minorities."
â€˜Has Hasina fallen yet?â€™,"A 24-year-old was fatally shot in Dhaka's Laxmibazar. A 10th-grader was gunned down in a similar manner in Savar. A 20-year-old was shot in the chest in Narayanganj. At least 400 lives (the actual number could be much higher) were lost when law enforcers opened fire on protesters during the recent unrest. But these victims are not just statistics; they are children, parents, and friends. In this report, we try to know the stories of three such names among these tragic numbers. Â  Abul Hossain Sajan, 20, had just regained consciousness lying in the Intensive Care Unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital after a seven-hour-long surgery at 3:00am on August 6. Finding his elder brother Md Anik, beside the bed, he asked, ""Has the Hasina-government fallen yet?"" ""It irked me a bit and I told him to rest. He had just gone through a critical surgery to remove a bullet that hit him in his chest the day before,"" Anik said. ""Leaving Sajan inside the ICU to let him rest and recuperate, I went out and found out that Sheikh Hasina had resigned and fled."" ""Half-an-hour later, I went back to Sajan and told him that Shaikh Hasina had resigned. My brother smiled as I told him this, and he closed his eyes. I thought he went back to sleep, but after some time, the on-duty doctor checked on him and said he was goneâ€¦"" Anik also said. ""My brother died in peace knowing that the dictator was gone,"" he added. Abul Hossain Sajan, a 20-year-old from Kushiara village in Narayanganj, had been a committed participant in the ongoing student protests against the government. Despite the risks, he joined the movement alongside his elder brother, Md Anik, on August 5. Their destination was Chashara Intersection, where they planned to join others in the ""March to Dhaka"" event, organised by the Anti-discriminatory Students' Movement. As they approached the intersection, the group of 11 protestors was ambushed by a mob of 50-60 men, believed to be Awami League supporters. Armed with firearms and sharp weapons, the attackers chased and fired at the protesters. In the chaos, Sajan became separated from his brother and was struck by a bullet in his chest. Sajan was initially rushed to Narayanganj General Hospital before being transferred to Dhaka Medical College Hospital , Sajan completed his HSC in 2022 but could not continue studying as his father Jakir Hossain passed away. He went on to join a soft drink manufacturing company as a sales representative, and eventually took the entire responsibility of the family after his elder brother became unemployed six months back. Meanwhile, Anik has filed a case accusing former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, along with former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan and 46 others over his brother's death. Former MP AKM Shamim Osman, his brother former MP AKM Selim Osman, son Imtinan Osman Ayon, nephew Azmery Osman were also among the accused."
Hasina faces 5 more cases,"Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was accused in five more cases yesterday. Four of the cases were filed in Dhaka over the killing of four people during the recent student-led movement, while another was filed in Rajshahi over the abduction and torture of a BNP leader in 2023. With this, Hasina is now facing 71 cases, including 60 for murder, seven for crimes against humanity and genocide, three for abduction, and one for attack on a BNP procession.

â€˜Gang of 4 behind Hasinaâ€™s fallâ€™,"An Awami League leader has blamed Sheikh Hasina's inner circle, who he described as the ""Gang of Four that cut her off from the ground reality"", for her fall and departure, reports The Indian Express. The Indian Express spoke to several leaders of the party who feel Hasina has abandoned them in such a situation that put their lives in danger with angry mobs targetting their homes and businesses. ""We were able to get out of our homes just in time, when the Army chief was addressing the nation around 3pm and people were glued to TV screens,"" one of the Awami League leaders told the Indian newspaper. ""My family and I would have been lynched and burnt alive had we been caught,"" another leader, who was a minister, said. The Indian Express said some of the Awami League leaders regretted the turn of events, especially the firing at the students and protesters in July, and then on August 3-4 when people came out on the streets. One of the leaders alleged that Hasina stopped listening to them, as he blamed her inner circle ""the Gang of Four"". He named Hasina's son and ICT adviser Sajeeb Wazed Joy, private industry and investment adviser Salman F Rahman, Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader and the then home minister Asaduzzaman Khan. ""This Gang of Four led to her downfall. She had blind faith in these people, and lost the political instinct that she had in the past,"" The Indian Express quoted him as saying. The Awami League leaders also described not bringing the BNP on board for the elections in January as Hasina's ""major mistake"". Citing sources, the newspaper said some AL leaders were put in touch with Tarique Rahman, the BNP acting chairman in exile in London, through intermediaries. But Hasina did not greenlight the proposal to establish a backchannel with Tarique in January 2023, a year before the elections. Tarique was convicted of plotting the grenade attack that targeted Hasina at an Awami League rally in 2004. ""We could sense the anger among the people due to corruption, chandabaaji (extortion), police atrocitiesâ€¦ and getting BNP on board for the elections would have taken that steam off. We could have still won and kept the party in power,"" the AL leader told The Indian Express. Even during the protests in early July, the AL leaders' bid to make Hasina meet the student movement leaders had failed, it said, citing sources. ""The last nail in the coffin was when the Detective Branch picked up the student leaders in July and released them after intimidating them and extracting a commitment to withdraw the agitation,"" the newspaper wrote. ""The tactic backfired, and the students made it public how they had been forcibly asked to withdraw the agitation. This triggered a chain of events, leading to her flight from the country."" The Bangladesh Army in a statement said it had provided shelter to 626 people from different walks of life, including 24 political leaders, five judges, 19 civil administration officials and 28 police officers, after the downfall of Hasina. Several top AL leaders, including members of her cabinet, have been arrested in cases over killings during the protests. Those who spoke to The India Express also feel the party, which spearheaded Bangladesh's struggle for independence after its formation 75 years ago, still has the ability to turn around despite the existential crisis. Fir this to happen, they told the Indian newspaper, Hasina should nominate people on the ground who have a connection with the people. ""This is going to be a long haul,"" one of the leaders said, talking about the future first steps â€¦. People are still angryâ€¦ We have to give them time."""

Hasina sued in five more murder cases,"Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was sued in five more murder cases over the deaths of five people in the capital's Jatrabari and Dhanmondi areas between July 19 and August 14. Hasina is now facing at least 90 cases, mostly for murders during the mass student protests that forced her to resign and flee the country on August 5. In the cases, former ministers Obaidul Quader, Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, Hasan Mahmud, Jahangir Kabir Nanak, and Dr Samanta Lal Sen, former lawmakers Shamim Osman, Nazrul Islam Babu, Ferdous Ahmed, and Mashiur Rahman Mollah Sajal, former IGP Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, and former DB additional commissioner Harun Or Rashid have also been made accused, among others. Four of those cases were filed with the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Saddam Hossain. After recording the complainants' statements in the four cases, the magistrate asked the officer-in-charge of Jatrabari Police Sation to register the complainants as first information report, said court sources. One Mohammad Ali filed a case against Hasina and 57 others over the death of his relative Obaidul Islam on August 4. According to the case statement, leaders and activists of the AL-led 14-party alliance fired on thousands of people with illegal weapons in front of Kajla Petrol Pump in Jatrabari on August 4 during the anti-discrimination student movement, where Obaidul died of bullet injuries. One Rubel filed a case against Hasina and 35 others over the death of his brother Rasel in the Kajla area on August 5.

According to case statement, Shuvo suffered bullet injuries in Dhanmondi on July 19 and died the next day while undergoing treatment at a city hospital. After recording the statement, the magistrate directed the PBI to investigate the complaint and submit a report.

How Hasinaâ€™s playbook was undone,"In her final days, Sheikh Hasina desperately clung to power as if she had full legitimacy, unmindful of a big crack in her armour. Her edifice crumbled a month ago on August 5. She fled Bangladesh, ending her iron-fisted rule of 15 years and leaving behind a legacy that established brutal authority over almost everything. A generation, to say the least, will remember her as a byname for intolerance to dissent, destruction of democratic institutions, rigged elections and utmost savagery in some cases. Sadly, her role in Bangladesh's economic prosperity for which she was feted globally will be a faded memory. The month leading to Hasina's dramatic downfall was littered with death and destruction. Trigger-happy security forces, who were blamed for hundreds of deaths as the protests turned violent in mid-July, were out with full force. Videos of police shooting point-blank at nonviolent protesters emerged almost every day. Her brutal tactics led to an unprecedented bloodbath in any mass uprising in the region in memory. Dystopian scenes vividly captured in photographs and videos by this newspaper as well as other media outlets will remain etched in our memory. Bangladesh became a symbol of nervous trauma. It was as if things were disintegrating from the centre. It also showed how peaceful protests lumbered into mindless mayhem. At one point, Hasina's government ordered a complete shutdown of the internet, the modern-day lifeline, knocking daily life out of balance, and taking Bangladesh back to the forgotten analogue age. That didn't quell the protests, started by university students but by now joined by people of every class and age groups, including women and children. The government deployed platoons of paramilitary troops alongside the police to stem the ferocity of demonstrations with teargas shells, rubber bullets and gunfire. But the day wasn't saved as one act of vengeance spawned another round of violence. Hasina's party unleashed its youth wing on the streets to reclaim their turf. Bloodbath continued unchecked. The death toll climbed. Hasina's government admitted, for the first time, that they were pushed to the wall, a comment that came with horrific finality. It was a precursor to something more ominous -- curfew. The deployment of the army on July 19, while it was undeniably necessary, tore the veil of stability that gave a fillip to the economy for more than a decade. The story of stability, sellable to foreign investors, lost much of its credibility. It also showed the government's struggle in its new term to hold things together as Bangladesh hurtled into an uncertain future. DAYS OF UNYIELDING ANGER Protests, anger and vengeance inhabited the period from July 16 to August 6. With the passing of each day, protests turned more violent and the mob burgeoned. In speed and scope, the violence went far beyond anything Hasina believed possible. Government establishments and vehicles were set on fire and two metro stations were vandalised in Mirpur. For their part, law enforcement agencies unleashed aerial fury by raining down rubber bullets and teargas shells on protesters from the sky, a newfound tactic. Street vendors and pedestrians were unwitting victims of the government's vengeance. Ambulances, their sirens on, ferried the injured to hospitals, stretching health services in Dhaka and beyond. According to an initial count by the United Nations, 650 people were killed in Bangladesh with nearly 400 deaths reported from July 16 to August 4, and a further 250 in the new wave of violence between August 5-6. The health adviser in the interim government later said the death toll could be as high as 1,000. The Daily Star has so far been able to confirm more than 550 deaths. The weight of the dead was too heavy. Shortly before midday, on August 5, Hasina was seen hurrying into a waiting helicopter in a disgraceful exit from Bangladesh. Her departure, which came after she lost the army's support, sparked jubilation across the country. Millions of people descended on the streets to celebrate the fall of her government, a significant turning point in the nation's history, amid dramatic and sometimes chaotic events. As the news of her exit spread, the day became more volatile. The entire nation was in flux. Thousands of people stormed Gono Bhaban, the prime minister's official residence, looting souvenirs, frolicking on the premises and grinning for selfies as they posed with the loot. People toppled a statue of independence leader and Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Arsonists set fire to the Bangabandhu Museum in Dhanmondi, in what the Crisis Group said was ""an act of grotesque retribution"". Reprisal attacks on Awami League leaders, sympathisers and religious minorities continued for the next few days.Â  It was almost unthinkable in January that Hasina's government would fall apart, just seven months into her fourth consecutive term, however deeply flawed the election may be. But support for the government was clearly waning. The largest opposition force, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, had boycotted the vote and turnout was conspicuously low. Global leaders were hesitant to congratulate Hasina on the win. Hasina returned to power after winning the 2008 election in a landslide, but she seemed to have lost confidence along the way and rigged the subsequent three elections to hold on to power. And the regime became increasingly unaccountable for its wrongdoing. Internally, her overbearing presence hollowed out the party and other members lost their voices and roles. It morphed into a one-person party, and as such, a one-person government. Hasina concentrated so much power in her hands and antagonised many who came into her orbit. The Awami League, which celebrated its 75th anniversary in June, and a party that has been a part of democratic movements from even before Bangladesh's independence, the leading party in Bangladesh's liberation war, seemed to have lost touch with the people. Over time, Hasina who fits the playbook of a dictator became emotionally detached, unable to empathise with the suffering of people. This detachment manifested itself in increasingly brutal responses to anti-government protests. To maintain control, Hasina, like an isolated authoritarian ruler, often resorted to widespread surveillance and violent crackdowns on dissent. These factors created a feedback loop where her isolation exacerbated paranoia and repressive tendencies, ultimately leading to a more oppressive regime. BEGINNING OF AN END Protests erupted in Bangladesh in early July, when students began agitating against the reintroduction of controversial quotas for government jobs. The movement emerged amid widespread discontent with Hasina's government, which had grown increasingly authoritarian and had badly mismanaged the economy. ""It was Hasina's reaction to the protests that was her downfall. She sealed her fate when she decided to crack down rather than pursue dialogue with protest leaders,"" the Crisis Group said in a report. As demonstrations swelled across the country in mid-July, law enforcement agencies tried but failed to suppress the student-led uprising with the majority of them being young protesters. Police and paramilitary units used ""unnecessary and disproportionate"" force and resorted to extrajudicial killings, a level of political violence rarely seen in Bangladesh since its independence in 1971. Even after the Supreme Court drastically reduced the job quotas on July 21, protests continued to gather steam, advancing new demands, including accountability for the killings and the government's resignation. That showed signs of Hasina's troubles ahead. On August 4, a final, terrible round of bloodshed before the collapse of the government left close to 100 people dead, most of them protesters shot by police and ruling-party members acting as vigilantes. The next day, hundreds of thousands heeded student leaders' calls to march on Dhaka and poured into Shahbagh, defying another curfew. Just six kilometres away, Hasina packed up and fled Gono Bhaban. She found refuge in India, the next-door neighbour."
One month into Hasinaâ€™s fall: Students to hold â€˜Shaheedi Marchâ€™ today,"The Anti-Discrimination Students Movement will take out ""Shaheedi March"" across the country today to mark the one month of the fall of the Hasina regime. ""We think it is time to remember those who lost their lives for the cause. That's why tomorrow, a month after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government [on August 5], we'll commemorate the martyrs with marches across the nation,"" said Sarjis Alam, one of the movement's coordinators, at TSC auditorium yesterday. ""I invite the families of every martyr to the march."" In Dhaka, the procession will begin at Raju Memorial Sculpture at 3:00pm and parade through Nilkhet, New Market, Kalabagan, Dhanmondi, Manik Mia Avenue, Farmgate, Karwan Bazar, Bangla Motor, and Shahbagh before ending at the Central Shaheed Minar. ""We will not celebrate the victory until the human and constitutional rights are restored. We must uphold the spirit of the movement,"" said Sarjis. He asked people to take part spontaneously and speak about the misrule of the last government and their desires from the interim government. Meanwhile, student leaders warned that law enforcement agencies would deal with anyone involved in controversial activities, like extortion and torture. ""We urge the people to hand over anyone attempting to tarnish the spirit of the student movement,"" said Abu Baker Majumder, another coordinator. He announced the formation of a fact-finding committee to identify those who opened fire on protesters during the uprising. On forming their own political party, Abu Baker said they would travel across the country and listen to people's opinion on the matter. Hasnat Abdullah, a key organiser of the movement, said, ""They [the Awami League government] used every state machinery for Awami League's fascism. Over the last 15 years, they made the culture of labelling people 'Jamaat-Shibir' to silence the voices of dissent."" He said the AL made a ""religion"" and ""portrayed Sheikh Mujib as a prophet"".Â  Hasnat said the AL established a culture in which Sheikh Mujib was beyond criticism and the people and the media had to accept it. He said the media was gagged or controlled by the government. ""A news that is liked by the government is not a news, rather it is merely a press release. We now request journalists to question the authorities."" He said, ""Some people are now taking to the streets with various demands. Why did they not raise any question in the last 15 years? Now we have learnt to question the authorities and we have to keep this up."" Hasnat said the constitution of 1972 was not a national constitution, rather it was AL's constitution. ""We accepted it as the national constitution and through that the Awami League first sowed the seeds of fascism. We have to remain united, so that fascism never returns. Now that we are united, they are trying to create divisions. ""We need to set some principles and values to reorganise the state to make sure that fascism cannot return in any form. We expect a state where the people will not have to take to the streets to realise any demand."""
Hasina must stay silent in India till Bangladesh seeks her extradition: Yunus,"In an interview with Press Trust of India, the Chief Adviser of Bangladesh's interim government, Prof Muhammad Yunus, has made a strong case for former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's return from India to face trial for atrocities she committed in Bangladesh. The interview, conducted last Sunday at the Chief Adviser's official residence in Dhaka and released today, reflects the interim government's commitment to ensuring justice for the people of Bangladesh. ""She has to be brought back, or the people of Bangladesh won't be at peace. The kind of atrocities she has committed must be addressed through a trial here,"" Yunus said. He criticised Hasina's political remarks from India, calling them an ""unfriendly gesture"" that causes discomfort in both countries. ""If India wants to keep her until the time Bangladesh (government) wants her back, the condition would be that she has to keep quiet,"" PTI quoted Yunus as saying. ""No one is comfortable with her stance there in India because we want her back to try her. She is there in India and at times she is talking, which is problematic. Had she been quiet, we would have forgotten it; people would have also forgotten it as she would have been in her own world. But sitting in India, she is speaking and giving instructions. No one likes it,"" he said. Yunus was apparently referring to Hasina's statement on August 13 in which she demanded ""justice"", saying those involved in recent ""terror acts"", killings and vandalism must be investigated, identified and punished. ""It is not good for us or for India. There is discomfort regarding it,"" he said. Asked whether Bangladesh has communicated its stance to India, Yunus said it has been conveyed verbally and quite firmly that she should keep quiet. ""Everyone understands it. We have said quite firmly that she should keep quiet. This is an unfriendly gesture towards us; she has been given shelter there and she is campaigning from there. It is not that she has gone there on a normal course. She has fled following a people's uprising and public anger,"" he said. Yunus said that while Bangladesh values strong ties with India, New Delhi must move ""beyond the narrative that portrays every other political party except Awami League as Islamist and that the country will turn into Afghanistan without Sheikh Hasina."" ""The way forward is for India to come out of the narrative. The narrative is that everybody is Islamist, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is Islamist, and everyone else is Islamist and will make this country into Afghanistan. And Bangladesh is in safe hands with Sheikh Hasina at the helm only. India is captivated by this narrative. India needs to come out of this narrative. Bangladesh, like any other nation, is another neighbour,"" he said. Referring to the recent incidents of attacks on Hindu minorities in Bangladesh and India flagging concerns about it, Yunus said this is just an ""excuse"". ""The issue of trying to portray the conditions of minorities in such a big way is just an excuse,"" he said. Asked about ways to improve the India-Bangla relations, Yunus said both the countries need to work together and it is on a downhill presently. ""We need to work together to improve this relationship, which is now at a low,"" he said. Speaking about the future of bilateral treaties with India, Yunus said there are demands for a relook at certain treaties such as transit and the Adani power deal. ""Everybody is saying that it is needed. We will see what is on paper and, second, what is actually happening on the ground. I can't answer it specifically. If there is any need to review, we will then raise questions about it,"" he said."

How Hasinaâ€™s playbook was undone,"In her final days, Sheikh Hasina desperately clung to power as if she had full legitimacy, unmindful of a big crack in her armour. Her edifice crumbled a month ago on August 5. She fled Bangladesh, ending her iron-fisted rule of 15 years and leaving behind a legacy that established brutal authority over almost everything. A generation, to say the least, will remember her as a byname for intolerance to dissent, destruction of democratic institutions, rigged elections and utmost savagery in some cases. Sadly, her role in Bangladesh's economic prosperity for which she was feted globally will be a faded memory. The month leading to Hasina's dramatic downfall was littered with death and destruction. Trigger-happy security forces, who were blamed for hundreds of deaths as the protests turned violent in mid-July, were out with full force. Videos of police shooting point-blank at nonviolent protesters emerged almost every day. Her brutal tactics led to an unprecedented bloodbath in any mass uprising in the region in memory. Dystopian scenes vividly captured in photographs and videos by this newspaper as well as other media outlets will remain etched in our memory. Bangladesh became a symbol of nervous trauma. It was as if things were disintegrating from the centre. It also showed how peaceful protests lumbered into mindless mayhem. At one point, Hasina's government ordered a complete shutdown of the internet, the modern-day lifeline, knocking daily life out of balance, and taking Bangladesh back to the forgotten analogue age. That didn't quell the protests, started by university students but by now joined by people of every class and age groups, including women and children. The government deployed platoons of paramilitary troops alongside the police to stem the ferocity of demonstrations with teargas shells, rubber bullets and gunfire. But the day wasn't saved as one act of vengeance spawned another round of violence. Hasina's party unleashed its youth wing on the streets to reclaim their turf. Bloodbath continued unchecked. The death toll climbed. Hasina's government admitted, for the first time, that they were pushed to the wall, a comment that came with horrific finality. It was a precursor to something more ominous -- curfew. The deployment of the army on July 19, while it was undeniably necessary, tore the veil of stability that gave a fillip to the economy for more than a decade. The story of stability, sellable to foreign investors, lost much of its credibility. It also showed the government's struggle in its new term to hold things together as Bangladesh hurtled into an uncertain future. DAYS OF UNYIELDING ANGER Protests, anger and vengeance inhabited the period from July 16 to August 6. With the passing of each day, protests turned more violent and the mob burgeoned. In speed and scope, the violence went far beyond anything Hasina believed possible. Government establishments and vehicles were set on fire and two metro stations were vandalised in Mirpur. For their part, law enforcement agencies unleashed aerial fury by raining down rubber bullets and teargas shells on protesters from the sky, a newfound tactic. Street vendors and pedestrians were unwitting victims of the government's vengeance. Ambulances, their sirens on, ferried the injured to hospitals, stretching health services in Dhaka and beyond. According to an initial count by the United Nations, 650 people were killed in Bangladesh with nearly 400 deaths reported from July 16 to August 4, and a further 250 in the new wave of violence between August 5-6. The health adviser in the interim government later said the death toll could be as high as 1,000. The Daily Star has so far been able to confirm more than 550 deaths. The weight of the dead was too heavy. Shortly before midday, on August 5, Hasina was seen hurrying into a waiting helicopter in a disgraceful exit from Bangladesh. Her departure, which came after she lost the army's support, sparked jubilation across the country. Millions of people descended on the streets to celebrate the fall of her government, a significant turning point in the nation's history, amid dramatic and sometimes chaotic events. As the news of her exit spread, the day became more volatile. The entire nation was in flux. Thousands of people stormed Gono Bhaban, the prime minister's official residence, looting souvenirs, frolicking on the premises and grinning for selfies as they posed with the loot. People toppled a statue of independence leader and Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Arsonists set fire to the Bangabandhu Museum in Dhanmondi, in what the Crisis Group said was ""an act of grotesque retribution"". Reprisal attacks on Awami League leaders, sympathisers and religious minorities continued for the next few days.Â  It was almost unthinkable in January that Hasina's government would fall apart, just seven months into her fourth consecutive term, however deeply flawed the election may be. But support for the government was clearly waning. The largest opposition force, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, had boycotted the vote and turnout was conspicuously low. Global leaders were hesitant to congratulate Hasina on the win. Hasina returned to power after winning the 2008 election in a landslide, but she seemed to have lost confidence along the way and rigged the subsequent three elections to hold on to power. And the regime became increasingly unaccountable for its wrongdoing. Internally, her overbearing presence hollowed out the party and other members lost their voices and roles. It morphed into a one-person party, and as such, a one-person government. Hasina concentrated so much power in her hands and antagonised many who came into her orbit. The Awami League, which celebrated its 75th anniversary in June, and a party that has been a part of democratic movements from even before Bangladesh's independence, the leading party in Bangladesh's liberation war, seemed to have lost touch with the people. Over time, Hasina who fits the playbook of a dictator became emotionally detached, unable to empathise with the suffering of people. This detachment manifested itself in increasingly brutal responses to anti-government protests. To maintain control, Hasina, like an isolated authoritarian ruler, often resorted to widespread surveillance and violent crackdowns on dissent. These factors created a feedback loop where her isolation exacerbated paranoia and repressive tendencies, ultimately leading to a more oppressive regime. BEGINNING OF AN END Protests erupted in Bangladesh in early July, when students began agitating against the reintroduction of controversial quotas for government jobs. The movement emerged amid widespread discontent with Hasina's government, which had grown increasingly authoritarian and had badly mismanaged the economy. ""It was Hasina's reaction to the protests that was her downfall. She sealed her fate when she decided to crack down rather than pursue dialogue with protest leaders,"" the Crisis Group said in a report. As demonstrations swelled across the country in mid-July, law enforcement agencies tried but failed to suppress the student-led uprising with the majority of them being young protesters. Police and paramilitary units used ""unnecessary and disproportionate"" force and resorted to extrajudicial killings, a level of political violence rarely seen in Bangladesh since its independence in 1971. Even after the Supreme Court drastically reduced the job quotas on July 21, protests continued to gather steam, advancing new demands, including accountability for the killings and the government's resignation. That showed signs of Hasina's troubles ahead. On August 4, a final, terrible round of bloodshed before the collapse of the government left close to 100 people dead, most of them protesters shot by police and ruling-party members acting as vigilantes. The next day, hundreds of thousands heeded student leaders' calls to march on Dhaka and poured into Shahbagh, defying another curfew. Just six kilometres away, Hasina packed up and fled Gono Bhaban. She found refuge in India, the next-door neighbour."
"'March for Justice': Students, DU teachers stage sit-in in front of Curzon Hall","The white panel of Dhaka University teachers staged a sit-in programme in front of Curzon Hall for around 45 minutes this afternoon. The sit-in started in front of the hall around 1:00pm after police stopped them from going to the courts, as originally intended. Students of different institutions, including Buet and DU, had joined the teachers' sit-in when this report was filed around 1:15pm. They later left the spot around 2:00pm, with a section of students marching towards the Central Shaheed Minar.Â  The sit-in is part of the ""March for Justice"" programme of the Anti-Discrimination Students' Movement protesting mass killings, arrests, attacks, cases, disappearances of students and people across the country. They were chanting various slogans including ""Amar bhai bhitore, tumi keno bahire"", ""We want justice"". Quota reform protests organisers yesterday announced ""March for justice"" programme for today at educational institutions, court premises and major roads, to press home their nine-point demand."
"2 more murder cases filed against Hasina, Quader in Gazipur","Two more murder cases have been filed against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and former road transport and bridges minister Obaidul Quader in Gazipur. The two cases were filed on Sunday and yesterday, our local correspondent reports quoting Sreepur Police Station Officer-in-Charge KM Sohel Rana. Former ministers Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) President Hasanul Haque Inu and a number of local Awami League leaders and activists were made accused in the cases. One of the victims was Md Kabir, son of Abdur Rahman of â€‹â€‹Gafargaon upazila of Mymensingh. Kabir lived with his family in Sreepur upazila of Gazipur. Another victim was Shifat Ulla, who was from Charkaona village of Kishoreganj's Pakundia upazila. He was studying at Jamia Islami Emdadul Uloom and Orphanage in Channapara under Sreepur municipality area. He lived in the dormitory of the educational institution. Kabir's mother Jamila Khatun lodged one of the cases against Hasina, Quader and 84 named and 400/500 unidentified people. Sifat's father Hafez Maulana Nuruzzaman filed the other case with the police station accusing 42 named, including Hasina and Quader, and 150/200 unidentified people. According to police, on August 5 two buses carrying members of the Border Guard Bangladesh were attacked and set on fire in Mulaid area on Dhaka-Mymensingh highway in Sreepur upazila. Both Kabir and Sifat died in the ensuing clash."
"Hasina, Rehana, 85 others sued in Sylhet","Another case was filed today against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, her sister Sheikh Rehana and 85 others on charge of attacking a procession in Sylhet citywhich left several people shot and injured during the recent mass protests on August 4. Juber Ahmed, acting president of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal's Sylhet city unit, filed the case with the court of Sylhet Metropolitan Magistrate Suman Bhuiya this noon. AL's general secretary and former road transport minister Obaidul Quader, former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan, former foreign minister Hasan Mahmud, former law minister Anisur Rahman, and former advisor to the prime minister Salman F Rahman were also named in the case, reports our local correspondent. Former state minister for expatriate affairs Shafiqur Rahman Chowdhury, former parliamentarians Kamrul Ahsan, Hasanul Haque Inu, Rashed Khan Menon, Habibur Rahman and Shafiul Alam Chowdhury Nadel, former IGP Abdullah Al Mamun, former additional IGP Harun-or-Rashid, former Sylhet city mayor Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury, former Sylhet Zilla Parishad chairman Nasir Uddin Khan, Bangladesh Chhatra League leaders, and police officials were also made accused in the case. According to the case statement, the accused attacked a peaceful rally, brought out by BNP and its associate organisations in Sylhet City's Bandarbazar area on August 4, which left several shot and injured. With these cases, Hasina is now facing 33 cases against her, including 27 for murder, four for crimes against humanity and genocide, and one for abduction."
"Hasina sued in yet another murder case, former CJ Khairul accused as well","Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, former chief justice ABM Khairul Haque and three others were sued over the killing of Firoz Talukder, an office assistant of Rangpur Chemical Ltd, who was shot from a helicopter during clashes centring on the quota reform movement in Dhaka's Mirpur area on July 19. The three other accused in the case are Awami League General Secretary and former road transport and bridges minister Obaidul Quader, former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan and former inspector general of police Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Manun. The victim's wife, Reshma Sultana, filed the case with the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Mehedi Hasan. Upon hearing, the magistrate recorded the statement of the complainant and asked the officer-in-charge of Mirpur Model Police Station to register it as a first information report (FIR). In her complaint, the complainant said her husband was crossing the Mirpur-10 intersection around 6:00pm on July 19 when Rapid Action Battalion members fired from a helicopter, leaving the victim dead. Sheikh Hasina, ABM Khairul Haque and three others were named as masterminds behind the firing that killed the victim, said the complaint. With these cases, Hasina is now facing 32 cases against her, including 27 for murder, four for crimes against humanity and genocide, and one for abduction."
Extradite ousted Hasina to Bangladesh,"BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir yesterday asked India to extradite ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh and let her face trial here. ""It is our call to you that you should hand her over to the government of Bangladesh in a legal way. The people of this country have given the decision for her trial. Let her face that trial,"" he said. The BNP secretary general made this call while talking to reporters after paying tribute to BNP founder President Ziaur Rahman in the city. ""Staying there, she[Hasina] has started various plots to thwart the revolution that happened in Bangladesh,"" he alleged."
Hasina's ex-deputy press secy Ashraful faces ACC probe  ,"The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) today decided to launch a probe against Ashraful Alam Khokan, a former deputy press secretary to former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, for amassing illegal assets. The decision was made during a meeting held at the ACC headquarters, a senior official of the ACC told The Daily Star. ACC sources said the decision to probe came after allegations were made against Khokan, who holds dual citizenship of Bangladesh and the United States, that he has amassed a vast amount of wealth through corruption. ACC has found that four private cars are registered in his name. Khokan held the post of PM's deputy press secretary from 2013 to 2021."
Hasina to return once polls called,"Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina will return home as soon as the interim government decides to hold an election, said her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy in an interview with Times of India on Thursday. ""For the time being, she is in India. She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election. I am thankful to PM Narendra Modi for saving my mother's life at such short notice."" Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled Bangladesh on August 5 when a student-led protest culminated in a mass uprising against her Awami League government. More than 400 people were killed in the preceding three weeks, with a majority of them being shot by police and AL activists. Stating that the AL leaders were still allegedly being attacked in Bangladesh, Joy said, ""I will do whatever it takes to save the party and its workers. If there is a need for me to join politics, I will not refrain from that. My mother would have retired from politics after the current term. I never had any political ambition and was settled in the US. ""But the developments in Bangladesh in the past few days show that there is a leadership vacuum. I had to get active for the sake of the party and I am at the forefront now."" While more than 140 people were killed in the mob violence and rioting on August 5 following Hasina's fleeing, the violence has reduced markedly since then as the students have been on the streets in the absence of law enforcers, and the security forces also becoming active amid reports of looting at night. Attacks against the Hindu community have also been reported, especially outside Dhaka. Speaking soon after the new interim government led by Nobel laureate Prof Muhammad Yunus took charge of Bangladesh, Joy said, ""I am sure the Awami League will take part in the election and we might even win. We have the largest supporter base in Bangladesh."" He also claimed that his mother has no plans for seeking asylum in any country. Joy stressed there was a need for ""introspection"". ""There definitely were 'mistakes'. When you run a country, a lot of decisions are made every day. Awami League believes in introspection and we were ready for that. But we did not get a chance to do that this time. We never realised the situation would escalate so fast."" He also said an alliance of BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami will not be able to save the religious minority people. ""If the Awami League is not in power, the eastern border of India will not be secure. If there is an alliance of BNP and Jamaat, that may not be good for India as Jamaat will not refrain from militancy,"" Joy said, requesting India to mount pressure on Bangladesh to hold elections soon. The AL government, during its 15 years in power, and Hasina herself were sharply critical of any political opponent or civil society member calling for foreign pressure in domestic policies. Joy's comments come after he had earlier in the week said that his family were ""done with politics""."
Will burn down media houses if they publish Hasina's photo,"BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's advisor Ruhul Quddus Talukder Dulu yesterday threatened to set ablaze newspapers and television channels which will publish photos of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. ""No TV channel or newspaper could publish photos and speeches of BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman. We want to say that if any TV channels or newspapers broadcast the photos of this murderer (Sheikh Hasina) who killed students, those [televisions and newspaper] will be set on fire,"" said Dulu. The BNP leader came up with the remarks while speaking as the chief guest at a sit-in programme near Natore district BNP office yesterday (Thursday) noon, reports our Natore correspondent. District BNP arranged the event demanding the trial of Sheikh Hasina and her associates for the killing of students and people. Dulu said if Jamaat is banned for genocide, why won't Awami League be banned for brutally killing thousands of students. ""Our demand is to ban Awami League as soon as possible."" He said she (Sheikh Hasina) is plotting a counter-coup, but students and people of this country will build resistance again. They [AL] have no chance to come to power. Dulu also said, ""We will do whatever is necessary to keep Natore peaceful and terror free along with common people of Natore, students, and journalists."" BNP national executive committee member Kazi Golam Morshed, district BNP member secretary Rahim Newaz, and joint convener Farhad Ali Dewan Shahin, among others, spoke in the programme."
India pressed US to go easy on Hasina: report,"A year before she was deposed on August 5 in a student uprising, Indian officials began to lobby their US counterparts to stop pressuring Sheikh Hasina, the ironfisted prime minister of neighboring Bangladesh, The Washington Post said quoting US and Indian officials. According to its report, US diplomats had publicly harangued the 76-year-old Hasina for jailing thousands of her rivals and critics ahead of an election scheduled for last January. The Biden administration had sanctioned a Bangladeshi police unit under Hasina's command accused of carrying out extrajudicial abductions and killings and had threatened imposing visa restrictions on Bangladeshis who undermined democracy or committed human rights abuses. But in a series of meetings, Indian officials demanded that the United States tone down its pro-democracy rhetoric. If the opposition were allowed to gain power in an open election, Indian officials argued, Bangladesh would become a breeding ground for Islamist groups posing a threat to India's national security. ""You approach it at the level of democracy, but for us, the issues are much, much more serious and existential,"" said an Indian government adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks. ""There were a lot of conversations with the Americans where we said, 'This is a core concern for us, and you can't take us as a strategic partner unless we have some kind of strategic consensus.'"" Ultimately, the Biden administration substantially softened its criticism and shelved threats of further sanctions against Hasina's government, disappointing many in Bangladesh. US officials say it was a calculated decision that had little to do with Indian pressure. Many details of the bilateral discussions and US deliberations have not been reported previously. Now, after protesters defied the army's curfew orders and marched on Hasina's official residence, compelling her to flee to India, policymakers in both New Delhi and Washington are forced to confront whether they mishandled Bangladesh. ""There is always a balancing act in Bangladesh, as there is in many places where the situation on the ground is complicated and you want to work with the partners you have in a way that is not inconsistent with what the American people expect,"" said a US official, who like several others interviewed spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter's diplomatic sensitivity. In the months leading up to the January election, divisions emerged within the US government over how to handle Bangladesh. Some in the US State Department, including then-Ambassador Peter Haas and other embassy officials, argued for a tougher stance against Hasina, particularly since President Joe Biden had campaigned on a foreign policy plank of restoring democracy, people familiar with the matter said. Haas, who has since retired, declined to comment. Other US officials felt there was little to be gained from further alienating Hasina and risking the safety of US diplomats, including Haas, who had received threats from Hasina's followers. Some White House officials also considered the downside of antagonising India, which made a series of appeals to the US that it moderate its pressure on Hasina, including when Indian Minister of External Affairs S Jaishankar and Defense Minister Rajnath Singh met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in November in New Delhi, according to the people familiar with the matter. Indian national security adviser Ajit Doval also played a key role in presenting the Indian case during a visit to Washington that autumn, one of those people said. For India, the dramatic developments in Bangladesh have turned a spotlight on its decade-long, all-in bet on Hasina, even as she grew autocratic and unpopular. For the United States, the episode has highlighted a growing dilemma: While India is seen by the Biden administration as a crucial partner in countering China, India itself is increasingly viewed by its smaller neighbors in South Asia as a meddling, aggressively nationalist power under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In January, after Hasina claimed victory in a one-sided election with many of her opponents in jail or in hiding, Indian officials endorsed the election results, fueling calls from the Bangladeshi opposition for a boycott of Indian imports. Last year, in the tiny Indian Ocean country of the Maldives, Mohamed Muizzu rose to power as president by campaigning on an ""India Out"" platform. And in Sri Lanka, anti-Indian sentiment flared this year after Modi claimed on the campaign trail that his opponents gave India's rightful territory cheaply away to Sri Lanka. ""The US has built its relationship with India and has this tendency to defer to its wishes in the region, and probably nowhere was that more evident than Bangladesh,"" said Jon Danilowicz, a retired US diplomat who served as deputy chief of mission in Dhaka. ""But the risk is like Iran 1979: If you're seen as colluding with the dictator, when the dictator falls, you're left playing catch-up."" (The United States strongly backed the autocratic shah of Iran before he was overthrown during the Islamic Revolution.) Now, Danilowicz added, ""New Delhi and Washington have to show some humility and acknowledge they got Bangladesh wrong by not siding with the Bangladeshi people and their democratic aspirations."" After Hasina's ouster, which followed weeks of unrest in which hundreds of protesters were killed, Indian officials have publicly changed tack and expressed willingness to work with whoever comes to power. Last week, Modi sent his ""best wishes"" to Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Prize-winning banker who took charge of Bangladesh's interim government, even though he criticised India for backing Hasina. Yunus has called for new, free and fair elections once stability is restored in the country. The State Department endorsed Yunus, with spokesman Matthew Miller saying the United States hoped to see ""the Bangladeshi people decide the future of the Bangladeshi government."" Aside from the United States, India had simultaneously warned other Western governments about the dangers of the opposition Bangladeshi Nationalist Party (BNP) returning to power. ""It was intense,"" recalled an official from a Western country allied with the United States. ""They started briefing Western governments that Bangladesh could become the next Afghanistan, that the BNP could lead to instability, violence and terror."" Indian officials say they have reason to feel burned by the Bangladeshi opposition. During the rule of Hasina's rivals, the BNP, in the mid-2000s, militants smuggled weapons to attack northeast India and trained in camps inside Bangladesh with the help of Pakistani intelligence, Indian officials say. Indian and US officials say this experience with BNP rule explained why India had been so adamant on keeping Hasina in power for 15 years. BNP leaders, who could win if elections are soon held, say they have met Indian officials in recent years to mend ties and assure them that India â€” and Hindus in Bangladesh â€” would be safe if India stopped propping up Hasina and the BNP returned. ""We've been in touch with India, trying to tell them, 'Don't put all your eggs in one basket,'"" said Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury, a senior BNP leader. ""We have tried to assuage whatever concerns India has. It would be stupid for both sides to carry the baggage of the past."" As India grapples with the shock of suddenly losing one of its closest allies, Indian foreign policy circles and media have been awash with speculation that Washington orchestrated the removal of Hasina, who has long had a chilly relationship with the United States. US officials have staunchly denied the claim. Others in New Delhi say India was to blame for propping up an autocrat for so long. A former senior Indian national security official said it made sense, in theory, to support Hasina, but New Delhi did not grasp the situation on the ground. ""Everybody who came from Dhaka were giving the same feedback that anti-India feelings are at an unprecedented level, yet we calculated that she has full control over the administrative and coercive arms of the state,"" the former Indian official said. ""We thought repeated attempts to destabilise the government have failed, so she will manage again. The truth is, the whole thing just needed a spark to set the whole house on fire."""
Ouster of Hasina: BNP's Hafizuddin commends army,"BNP standing committee member Maj (retd) Hafizuddin Ahmed today congratulated the Bangladesh Army for its role in ""removing"" Sheikh Hasina from power. He was appointed member of the BNP standing committee yesterday. ""I had lost hope, but at the momentous occasion, the Bangladesh Army took sufficient and proper action to remove Sheikh Hasina. I congratulate them for this,"" Hafizuddin said during a programme, organised by Bangladesh Jatiotabadi Muktijoddha Dal at Jatiya Press Club. ""There was a lot of anger against them [Bangladesh Army]. The army is a traditional force. The language of army members, especially senior officers, should be soldier-like. But for the last 14 years, I have seen them giving speeches like those of Chhatra League. What a shameâ€¦ But in the end, they responded to the people's call and took the right action. They removed the dictator,"" he mentioned. He also questioned police's use of military-grade weapons during the recent crackdown. ""They are the police. Who gave them LMG, MG, 7.62 rifles of the military? Hasina's government did. These weapons were not supposed to be with them,"" he said."
Hasina hasn't decided yet on her next destination: Joy,"Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India after resigning as prime minister of Bangladesh in the face of a mass protest, has not decided yet about her next destination, said her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy. Joy in an interview with German based international broadcaster Deutsche Welle said the five-time prime minister is upset as she couldn't believe that people, for whom she and her family did so much, ccould stage an attack and she would need to leave the country ""disgracefully"". When the interviewer asked about Hasina's plan for asylum in United States, United Kingdom, he said, ""These are all rumors. She has not made a decision on that yet. She is going to stay in Delhi for a little while. ""My sister is with her. So she is not alone"", Joy said. The video interview was uploaded to the Facebook page of Deutsche Welle at midnight. Asked about her escape, and how Joy felt during that time, Joy said his mother didn't want to leave. ""I was worried not because she was leaving Bangladesh, but because she didn't want to leave Bangladesh. We had to convince her. ""I said this is not a political movement anymore, this is a mob â€¦ they are going to kill you,"" said Joy. Asked if the military or anyone set any timeframe for her to leave, Joy said there was no such deadline given by anybody. ""But there was a time estimate that the protester will reach the prime minister's residenceâ€¦ so there was no deadline set, though there was an estimate that if we don't move within this timeframe, then we won't be able to move,"" said Joy. Asked about why she did not announce her resignation, Joy said time is needed for some preparatory works for transition of power. Asked whether Hasina's leaving the country poses risk to Awami League activists, Joy said attacks on the Awami League men started before the fall of the government. He said attacks took place in Dhaka and different places, some of them were killed. ""All are blaming the government and Awami league [for the violence]. It is not right"". Asked if he has any plan to join politics now, he laughed and said ""There is no such plan right now. This is the third time a coup d'Ã©tat was staged against our family"". He said that all of his family members, except Hasina, are staying abroad for a long time and they are settled at their respective lives. He said that he worked hard for last 15 years for making digital Bangladesh without taking any pay. ""I don't have anything to say. If the people of Bangladesh do such thing we have nothing to say"". Asked about whether Sheikh Rehana and or any other family member will join politics, Joy said: ""It is not their duty anymore"" ""It seems that they are trying to finish Awami League and if election even held, there is a doubt whether they will allow AL to participate in it,"" he said, adding that, ""I cannot say my leaders and activists to come out or gathered at this dangerous period as they may face torture. Saving their lives is my first duty"". He, however, said that Awami League will not go extinct. ""If AL takes part in a free and fair election, AL will win it."" He said that no one discussed with AL about the interim government. ""If they held an election without AL, would half of the country's people accept that election? Supporters of AL will never accept it."" When his attention was drawn on to the fact that Nobel Laureate Prof Muhammad Yunus would be the chief adviser of the interim government, Joy said: ""I do not have comment on it"". He said civil society has been trying for a long time so that he gets a chance to lead the country. And he is now getting that scope. ""I want to see how he leads the country. Leading a country is not so easy,"" he added. He said through the media he can see that looting is taking place and the situation is similar to Syria. ""I do not know how the country will progress; it seems that the situation [of Bangladesh] will be like Pakistan"". ""People will soon start saying that Sheikh Hasina's rule was the golden period of Bangladesh"", he added."
Hasina destroyed Bangabandhuâ€™s legacy: Prof Yunus,"Sheikh Hasina, who was forced to resign as prime minister of Bangladesh yesterday amidst massive civil unrest in the country, destroyed the legacy of her father Bangabandhu Mujibur Rahman, Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus, told ThePrint. Speaking to ThePrint minutes after Hasina left Bangladesh, Yunus, who has been charged by the Hasina government in over 190 cases, said, ""Bangladesh is liberatedâ€¦ We are a free country now."" ""We were an occupied country as long as she (Hasina) was there. She was behaving like an occupation force, a dictator, a general, controlling everything. Today all the people of Bangladesh feel liberated."" Yunus was convicted by the Hasina-led government in January for violating the country's labour laws and is currently out on bail. The Nobel Laureate said this is like a second liberation for the people of Bangladesh and there is celebration all over the country. ""They are feeling the sense of liberation and joy that we can start all over againâ€¦.We wanted to do it in the first round when we became independent in 1971. And we missed it because of all the problems we have right now. We now want to make a fresh start and create a beautiful country for ourselves. That's the commitment we make and students and young people will be leading our future,"" he said. Asked about vandalism by protesters, who tried to damage a statue of Mujibur Rahman in Dhaka and stormed the parliament building, Yunus said that it's an expression of the ""damage she (Hasina) has done"". ""It says what they feel about Hasina, what she did to herself and her fatherâ€¦ it's not the fault of the young people who are doing this,"" he said. Yunus, founder of the pioneering microfinance system that lifted millions of poor out of poverty in Bangladesh, ruled out any role in active politics. ""I'm not the kind of person who would like to be in politics. Politics is not my cup of tea,"" he maintained. Currently in Paris, he said he would soon return to Bangladesh and continue to work for the people the way he did earlier. ""I will continue with my work in a more free environment that I didn't have during the regime of Sheikh Hasina because she was always attacking me. I will continue, devote myself to the things I could not do before,"" he said."
Hasina will not return to politics,"There will be no political comeback for Sheikh Hasina, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy told BBC yesterday, hours after the former Bangladesh prime minister resigned and left the country. Joy said Hasina was ""so disappointed that after all her hard work, for a minority to rise up against her"". Speaking to Newshour on the BBC World Service, Joy -- who was an official adviser of the prime minister until today â€“ said his mother was considering resigning since yesterday and had left the country for her own safety after her family insisted. ""She has turned Bangladesh around. When she took over power it was considered a failing state. It was a poor country. Until today it was considered one of the rising tigers of Asia. She's very disappointed."" On accusations that the government had dealt with protesters in a heavy-handed manner, he denied it, saying: ""You've had policemen beaten to death -- 13 just yesterday. So, what do you expect the police to do when mobs are beating people to death?"" Hundreds of people have died in the protests so far, with the vast majority protesters."
